<h1>Question</h1>
<p>Using the Pew Research Center’s data and the corresponding
questionnaire, consider Q46. Investigate how personal data (age,
education, income, etc.) are correlated to responses in Q46. Is there
other correlation between Q20, Q22, and Q23?</p>
<p>In the assignments folder post:</p>
<p>Include the weight variable in your response estimates Plots
(histogram, box, bar, scatter, etc.?) of the data. A brief explanation
of your analysis process and your interpretation of the data. (What is
the data, what did you do with the data, what do the results mean?) Your
Rmd file and knitted html file</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>This report investigates two major questions 1. correlations between

<h1>Overview of the Data</h1>
<p>The analysis is based on survey data from the Pew Research Center,
focusing on responses to question Q46.</p>
<p>Q 46. Do you think it’s good or bad for U.S. colleges and
universities to accept international students?</p>
<p>It has 2 options ‘good’ and ‘bad’ however unanswered question can be
considered as separate category ‘rejected’</p>
<p>Q 20. Overall, do you think having people of many different
backgrounds, such as different ethnic groups, religions and races, makes
the U.S.</p>
<p>It has 2 options ‘a better place to live’ and ’ a worse place to
live’ and unanwered question can be considered as ‘rejected’</p>
<p>Q 22. When it comes to important issues facing the U.S., people may
disagree over policies, but do you think most people</p>
<p>It has 2 options ‘Agree on the basic facts’ and ’ Disagree on the
basic facts’ and unanwered question can be considered as ‘rejected’</p>
<p>Q 23. In the U.S., do you think discrimination against people based
on their race or ethnicity is a.</p>
<p>It has 4 options ‘Very serious problem’, ‘Somewhat serious problem’,
‘Not too serious problem’, and ‘Not a problem at all’</p>
<p>Initially Q 46 is analyzed w.r.t to the personnel data particularly
age, education and income.</p>

<h1>Including the weight variable in the responses</h1>
<p>The next step in analyzing the survey data is to use the svydesign ()
function from R’s “survey” package to create a survey design object. We
need to state the survey design to properly use survey weights and other
design components for estimation.This will enable us to generalize to
the overall U.S. population.</p>
